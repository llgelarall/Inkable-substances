# My Experience as a Teaching Assistant: Communication Guidelines for Students

I am **Gelara Jafari Pouyani**, an M.Sc. computer science student focusing on hardware architecture at Shahid Beheshti University. As of June 2024, I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for five semesters. My experience includes working with graduate and undergraduate students in various courses.

As a TA who loves this role, I have taken on various responsibilities, such as designing theoretical and programming exercises, answering questions during exams, evaluating midterms and finals, assessing students' middle and final projects, addressing their project-related queries, and problem-solving in the classroom.

During these experiences, I faced challenges, which led me to prepare these principles to help students and other TAs foster a more professional relationship.

Some important notes:
- I was studying at an Iranian university, and because Iranian universities are different from others, these principles might only be applicable to them. For example, in Iranian universities, each course has its individual Telegram group, and students can send messages via Telegram directly. It's your preference to answer them or not, but if you are like me and enjoy helping them tackle the problem, I highly recommend you seriously consider the tips below.
- Another important note: most TAs in Iran are not paid for their services. Most of them take on this role to help and build a more productive academic community. Thus, please remember not to treat them as though it's their job to answer you and always express gratitude.

## Tips for Students

### 1. Ask Direct and Clear
Don't ask, "May I ask a question?" Instead, directly ask your question in one message. This will increase the chance of getting your answer as quickly as possible because, based on the preview, your TA can estimate how long it will take to answer and if it does not take too long, give a short response to solve the problem.

### 2. It's Not a 24/7 Role
Always ask your TA about their preferred times for responding questions and adhere to that schedule. For example, if they are available on even days from 1 PM to 6 PM, do not send them a message on odd days at 10 AM.

### 3. Be Patient
After asking a question, be patient. You will likely get an answer, but your TA might respond later due to their busy schedule. Some questions take time to answer, and remember that even your professor might not know the answer to everything.

### 4. Do Your Research First
Before asking a question, especially programming-related ones, do some preliminary research. Use Google, or ask GPT, and review at least the first page of search results. This will improve your learning and searching skills. TAs are not search engines.

### 5. Don't Delete Messages
Even if you find the answer before getting a response, do not delete your message (especially in Telegram). Instead, send a follow-up message explaining how you solved the problem and ask for an acknowledgment to confirm if your solution is correct.

### 6. Express Gratitude
After receiving an answer, always say thank you. If you don't show gratitude, don't expect future questions to be answered.

### 7. Maintain Politeness
Always be polite, regardless of the situation. Sometimes, you may feel frustrated with a problem, but remember that your TA is there to help. Politely explain your situation and ask for assistance. Avoid using rude or abusive language.

### 8. Send Clear Screenshots, Not Photos
Do not send a picture of your screen taken with your phone. Instead, take a clear screenshot and highlight the relevant parts if necessary.

### 9. Don't Send Your Code
Do not send large chunks of code or your entire codebase asking for revisions. For code review, you can use tools like GPT or Copilot.

### 10. How to Ask Questions
Before asking your question, provide a brief background of the steps you have taken. Sometimes, the issue may be related to a bug that did not appear before.

### 11. Score Disputes
You can have objections about your score. First, ask for clarification on why you lost points. If the explanation is unconvincing, have a respectful conversation. If you're still unsatisfied, you can talk to the TA supervisor.

## Tips for TAs

Before reading this section, I recommend reading the article ["Losing Faith in Fairness: How Universities Are Failing Top Students"] (https://gisink.com) discussing how the wrong TA can destroy a student's motivation and belief in academia.

### 1. Time is Money
To avoid misunderstandings, set specific days and times to answer students' questions. This helps students plan and ensures uninterrupted work for you.

### 2. Be Honest
If you're too busy or don't know the answer, be upfront with the student. You can say, "I am currently too busy to answer this question, please ask another TA or professor if it's urgent." Or, "I do not know the answer, give me some time to find it, or you can ask another TA or professor."

### 3. Be Professional
Even if you face rude language or behavior, stay professional. Politely remind the student to stop inappropriate behavior and report it to the professor if necessary. Remember, they are often facing challenges and deadlines for the first time.

### 4. Score is Reputation
The scores you assign shape the future of students. Always be fair and ethical in grading, and be aware that it affects your reputation.

### 5. Set Clear Expectations and Provide a Rubric
Clearly outline your expectations for each task and, if possible, provide a detailed rubric for scoring. This helps students understand how their work will be evaluated and what they should focus on.
