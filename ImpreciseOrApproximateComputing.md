# Recommended Papers on Imprecise/Approximate Computing


&#128161; As a researcher in the area of imprecise/approximate computing; and a member of the ICVLSI group who focuses on the hardware aspect of imprecise/approximate computing, I have collected a list of papers that are recommended to read if you want to be familiar with this area. These papers are not in any specific order and do not cover all aspects of imprecise/approximate computing. Additionally, these papers are more aligned with the research goals of the ICVLSI group. 

&#128161; For those eager to join the ICVLSI group, the papers marked by &#11088; are prioritized. We’re always excited to welcome passionate minds to our team, and I truly hope you'll join us for an incredible journey of innovation, collaboration, and breakthroughs in the world of imprecise computing!

This list will be continuously updated. If you have any question, feel free to drop me an [email](jafaripouyanigelara@gmail.com)&#9993;—I’m always happy to help!

&#128640; Happy reading!
