# Tailored Material for Computer Hardware Design Students

As someone who transitioned from software development to a master's program in hardware design without prior experience, I faced the challenge of quickly bridging the knowledge gap to engage in meaningful research. Through extensive self-study, I successfully navigated this learning curve and emerged as a top-ranked student in my field.

To help others on a similar path, I’ve curated a list of high-quality resources, mainly YouTube channels and playlists, that provide comprehensive knowledge in hardware design. These resources cover courses from top-ranked universities, lectures from renowned professors, and sessions from leading conferences, symposiums, and research groups.

I’m known for finding excellent study materials, so if you’re searching for something specific and haven’t found it yet, feel free to reach out to me via email.
