## Approximate Computing Tools & Benchmarks

As part of my work on a review paper about surveys in approximate computing, I came across a number of tools, benchmarks, and libraries that are often mentioned but not always listed in one place. So, I decided to collect and share them here in this repository.

The table below includes the name, year, link, and application field of each tool or benchmark I found while reviewing the literature. I’ll keep updating it as I go—and if you know something that’s missing, feel free to contribute!
