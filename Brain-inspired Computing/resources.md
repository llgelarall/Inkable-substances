# Brain-Inspired Computing Resources

**Short Introduction:**  
The following materials are collected and will be completed for those who have a background in hardware design and want to get familiar with brain-inspired computing, neuromorphic computing, and spiking neural networks. I am not an expert in these areas but out of my curiosity and due I looking for different approaches to designing energy-efficient systems, I have started to investigate and study these fields independently and only by myself.

**Elaborated Introduction:**  
I have always been fascinated by the neuro and cognitive science, and how our brain and perception work. Due to this obsession, since the ICVLSI research group was focused on the brain-computer interface (in addition to the approximate computing studies), I started my master's by joining this group in hope that I would work on BCI subjects and getting closer to the neuroscience dream of myself. Thanks to my super visionary supervisor, Dr Mahdini, and despite my lack of an electronic background but solid algorithmic and software background, I joined the approximate computing group. Alongside my studies in approximate computing, I took a bio-inspired computing course by Dr Mahdiani and I guess here is the point when the story began. At first sight, I realized that I was actually fascinated by the potential of neuro and cognitive science for practical usage like designing computing units inspired by our brainâ€”despite the classical notion that the brain is the most efficient and high-speed computer in the world which correct my previous vision. Unfortunately, the course did not cover spiking neural networks and neuromorphic computing, but I just got familiar with these concepts; however, due to time limitations and the high priority of my thesis, I had to set it aside.

One year later, as I embarked on my efforts to apply for PhD in hardware accelerators, I was faced with programs that aimed to design neuromorphic computing chips to mimic the brain. The main reason for me to pursue a PhD in hardware accelerators was to delve deeper into designing energy-efficient systems, which originated from my desire to reduce the inevitable effects of AI systems. Once again, I delved into neuromorphic computing. I figured out that although I did not have any specific background, I believed that this was the point that would answer my broader perspective on designing the most efficient systems like the brain for brain-like applications like LLMs. Thus, I decided to get out of my safe zone and not limit myself to the subjects and positions that I already had researched. I read more and figured out how fascinating it is when it combines with physics, biology, mathematics, and computer aspects like algorithms. I realized it was the point that I could satisfy my desire for knowledge, collaboration, and broadening my horizons, which can be combined with my background and expertise in hardware design.

Consequently, I started this repository to share what I have read, watched, and learned about brain-inspired computing in order to track my progress and maybe help others join this community.
